You probably think *you* make your decisions... but what if it’s mostly your brain’s chemistry?

Dopamine — the 'feel-good' chemical — doesn’t just give you pleasure. It’s a **motivation molecule**, a reward signal, and an attention-grabber. Tech companies know it. Addictive apps are designed to hijack it.

Every scroll, like, ping = dopamine hit.

But you can reclaim control:
- Be mindful of triggers (especially screens)
- Replace dopamine loops with long-term rewards
- Create habits that align with your real goals

The science of dopamine is not just interesting — it’s liberating.

Take charge. **Rewire your brain**, one intentional choice at a time.
